<h2>About Page</h2>
<p>
    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
    recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain when
    Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
    Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
    Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
    action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
    leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

        <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
        <p>
            In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the mountain city of The Lonely
            Mountain.
            Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug
            in TA
            2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he
            participated in the
            Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria.
            At some
            point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the floor as a shield, he
            gained
            the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even in death.

        <h3>Fili and Kili</h3>
        <p>
            Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. They were also nephews
            of
            Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his
            long nose,
            the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

        <h3>Oin &amp; Gloin</h3>
        <p>
            Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger child of Gróin and
            younger brother of Óin.

            In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of the
            Dwarves and Orcs, though it is unknown how significant his contribution was, being 16 years old.

            In TA 2879, in the Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born to him and an unknown wife. In
            March of TA 2941 in Bree, Thorin Oakenshield met by chance the wizard Gandalf the Grey, pushing Thorin to
            reclaim Erebor, so that Smaug wouldn't ally with Sauron. When Gandalf mentioned Hobbits, Glóin referred them
            as "simpletons" and also said that Hobbits "would never dare to come within smelling distance of the
            nakedest dragonet new from the shell".
        </p>
        <p>Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was Fundin,
            the father of Balin and Dwalin. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought in the
            Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and Company on the
            quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo
            would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge
            of preparing the fire for the Company as they were the most skilled out of the others. He fought in and
            survived the Battle of Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain with King Dáin II Ironfoot,
            along with many other Dwarves of The Company of Thorin.</p>

        <h3>Balin</h3>
        <p>
            Balin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the dragon Smaug. He had a younger brother
            named Dwalin, and was amongst those driven from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely Mountain.
            Afterwards, he may have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs
            which culminated in the Battle of Azanulbizar. Many years later, in approximately TA 2841, he accompanied
            Thráin II, the father of Thorin, when he attempted to go back to the Lonely Mountain himself, but Thráin was
            captured and lost.[1]

            <h3>Dwalin</h3>
            <p>
                Born in TA 2772, two years after the dragon Smaug had desolated Erebor, Dwalin was the son of Fundin and
                younger brother of Balin. After fighting in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin
                accompanied
                Thráin II and Thorin Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin.

        <h3>Ori, Dori &amp; Nori</h3>
        <p>
            An unnamed woman started the family by marrying a first husband. Through their relationships, she had a son
            named Dori. The woman later married a second time, which resulted in their son, Nori. Then, she married a
            third and final time and had a son named Ori. Sometime later, their parents both pass away and Dori is left
            raising Nori and Ori on his own. However, Nori becomes a trouble maker by thieving or disobeying the law
            while Ori studied to become a scribe.

            The three brothers later joined Thorin's company in TA 2941 and also fought and survived in the battle of
            the Five Armies. While Nori and Dori stayed in their home at Erebor, Ori went with Oin, Balin and several
            other dwaarves before being killed in the battle in Moria.

        <h3>Bifur, Bofur &amp; Bombur</h3>
        <p>
            Bombur was a Dwarf who accompanied Thorin Oakenshield and Bilbo Baggins on their quest to the Lonely
            Mountain as part of the company, alongside his brother Bofur and cousin Bifur. Bombur was noted as the
            fattest Dwarf in the company.

        <h3>Gandalf</h3>
        <p>
            Gandalf the Grey, later known as Gandalf the White, and originally named Olórin (Quenya; IPA: [oˈloːrin]),
            was an Istar (Wizard), dispatched to Middle-earth in the Third Age to combat the threat of Sauron. He joined
            Thorin II Oakenshield and his company to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from Smaug, helped form the Fellowship
            of the Ring to destroy the One Ring, and led the Free Peoples in the final campaign of the War of the Ring.

            As a wizard and the bearer of one of the Three Rings, Gandalf has great power, but works mostly by
            encouraging and persuading. He sets out as Gandalf the Grey, possessing great knowledge, and travelling
            continually, always focused on the mission to counter the Dark Lord Sauron. He is associated with fire, his
            ring being Narya, the Ring of Fire, and he both delights in fireworks to entertain the hobbits of the Shire,
            and in great need uses fire as a weapon. As one of the Maiar he is an immortal spirit, but being in a
            physical body on Middle-earth, he can be killed in battle, as he is by the Balrog from Moria. He is sent
            back to Middle-earth to complete his mission, now as Gandalf the White and leader of the order of wizards.
